## Description

The `webtty` CLI is a thin client that controls a running webtty server over HTTP. It handles two concerns: server lifecycle (start/stop the server) and session management (create/list/remove/rename sessions via the REST API).

The help output uses `webtty help` as the canonical entry point. `--help` is not advertised but still works. The description line and command table are formatted for scannability: slogan first, usage second; commands ordered by frequency of use; optional args use `[bracket]` style throughout.

The CLI communicates with the server exclusively over HTTP to localhost — no Unix sockets, no PID files, no process signals. Whether the server is running is determined by a single question: does `GET /api/sessions` respond? Connection refused means not running. This works identically on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

**Why HTTP over Unix socket?** webtty already speaks HTTP — reusing the same interface keeps the surface area minimal and makes the CLI trivially debuggable with `curl`. Unix sockets offer lower latency but the difference is imperceptible for CLI interactions.

**Why Commander.js?** Zero dependencies, 18ms startup, TypeScript-native, used by Vue CLI and Vite. Yargs and oclif are heavier and provide features (plugin systems, config files) that are unnecessary here.

**Why no PID file?** PID files require platform-specific signal handling (`SIGTERM` on Unix, `TerminateProcess` on Windows) and go stale if the server crashes. HTTP-only detection is simpler, cross-platform, and sufficient — the server owns its own shutdown via `POST /api/server/stop`.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `webtty at [id]` | Start server if not running; create session (auto-generates ID if omitted) or reuse if ID exists; open session URL in the default browser. Alias: `attach` (undocumented) |
| `webtty rm [id]` | `DELETE /api/sessions/:id` — kill session and its PTY |
| `webtty ls [id]` | `GET /api/sessions` — list sessions; if `[id]` is given, filter by substring match |
| `webtty rename [id] [new-id]` | `PATCH /api/sessions/:id` — rename a session; session URL updates to reflect new id |
| `webtty start` | Fork server, wait for `GET /api/sessions` to respond |
| `webtty stop` | `POST /api/server/stop` — server cleans up and exits |
| `webtty` | No-arg entry point — start server if not running, then delegate to `webtty run main` |
| `webtty config` | Open `~/.config/webtty/config.json` in `$EDITOR` (falls back to `$VISUAL`, then `vi`) |
| `webtty help` | Show help — all commands |

## No-arg entry point

`webtty` with no arguments:

1. Start the server if not already running
2. Delegate to `webtty at main` — create or reuse the `main` session and open it in the browser

This is the canonical quickstart: `npx webtty` or `bunx webtty` goes from zero to a browser terminal in one command.## Help command

`webtty help` prints all commands. The `-h` / `--help` flag is not advertised but still works if users reach for it.

This makes the welcome banner's call-to-action (`Run \`bunx webtty help\` for more information.`) functional.

## Config command

`webtty config` opens `~/.config/webtty/config.json` in the user's preferred editor:

1. Resolve editor: `$EDITOR` → `$VISUAL` → `vi`
2. Ensure the config file exists (first-run write happens on server startup, but `webtty config` may run before the server has ever started)
3. Spawn the editor with the config path, inheriting stdio so the terminal is fully handed off

The command exits when the editor exits.
