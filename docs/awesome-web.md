# Awesome Web

A personal guide to living in the browser.

## Why the Browser

The browser is where you already spend your time. One window, sync across devices, no install friction. The web platform caught up — most apps you need run well in it now.

**The principle**: if a web version exists and it's good enough, use it. Not because native is bad, but because staying in the browser means fewer windows, fewer context switches, and a setup that works the same everywhere — your main machine, a work laptop, a tablet, or a borrowed computer.

You don't need a native app for everything.

## Best Practices

### Browser Choice

Pick one, stick with it. Cross-device sync matters more than features.

| Browser | Why Pick It |
|---------|------------|
| **[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com)** | Most customizable — hide the address bar entirely for a minimal, distraction-free UI |
| **[Arc](https://arc.net)** | Minimal by default — no tab bar, no address bar, sidebar-first |
| **[Zen](https://zen-browser.app)** | Same minimal philosophy as Arc, open source |
| **[Edge](https://microsoft.com/edge)** | Enable vertical tab bar to collapse the top area to a single line |
| **[Chrome](https://google.com/chrome)** | Enable vertical tab bar to collapse the top area to a single line |

### Password Manager

**[KeeWeb](https://keeweb.info)** — KeePass-compatible, open source, works as an offline web app with no install. Syncs your `.kdbx` file via Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or your own server. Desktop apps available too if you want them.

### Productivity Suite

#### Google Workspace

Google was the first to push the browser-first model seriously. All web-native from the start, still the gold standard for real-time collaboration.

- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com)
- [Drive](https://drive.google.com)
- [Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
- [Docs](https://docs.google.com)
- [Slides](https://slides.google.com)
- [Meet](https://meet.google.com)
- [Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)

If you're starting fresh or don't have org constraints, Google Workspace is the easiest path. Everything syncs, everything works offline, and sharing is built in.

#### Microsoft 365

Office Online has caught up. Word, Excel, PowerPoint in the browser are now good enough for most tasks. If your org is on M365, lean into it — everything works in the browser.

- [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com)
- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com)
- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com)
- [Word](https://word.office.com)
- [Excel](https://excel.office.com)
- [PowerPoint](https://powerpoint.office.com)

#### AI Assistants

The major AI assistants all live in the browser — no install needed.

### IDE

VS Code has three browser modes — they're different products, often confused:

**[VS Code `serve-web`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server)** — Run `code serve-web` on your machine, open the URL in any browser. Fully self-hosted, no Microsoft infrastructure. Full VS Code with terminal, extensions, and debugger — the browser-first way to run your editor.

**[code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server)** — Open source, self-hosted VS Code server by Coder. Same idea as `serve-web` but community-driven, more deployment options, and multi-user capable. Total control over your setup.

**[vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev)** — Runs entirely in your browser, no server needed. Zero setup, works on any device. Opens GitHub repos directly (`vscode.dev/github/<org>/<repo>`). No terminal, no debugger, and many extensions don't work because there's no backend to run them on.

| | `serve-web` | code-server | vscode.dev |
|--|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Terminal | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Self-hosted | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Extensions | ✅ full | ✅ full | ⚠️ limited |
| Setup | Easy | Medium | None |
| Best for | Local network | Self-hosted teams | Quick browsing |

### Terminal

Great native terminals exist — [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm), [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) — but a browser terminal keeps you in one window, makes sessions just URLs, and removes the context switch between editor and terminal. On Windows especially, the native multiplexer story is weak — no tmux, limited Zellij support — and the browser fills that gap naturally.

Here's every known approach and how they compare:

| Tool | Sessions | Windows | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| **[webtty](https://github.com/jesse23/webtty)** (current repo) | ✅ | ✅ | Lightweight, session-aware, cross-platform |
| **[VibeTunnel](https://github.com/amantus-ai/vibetunnel)** | ✅ | ❌ | macOS/Linux, built for AI agent monitoring, native menu bar app + `vt` command wrapper |
| **[ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd)** | ❌ | ✅ | One shell per URL; session terminates when the connection drops |
| **[GoTTY](https://github.com/yudai/gotty)** | ❌ | ❌ | Lightweight Go tool, abandoned since 2017 |
| **[Zellij](https://zellij.dev)** (web mode) | ✅ | ❌ | Full multiplexer with web mode, Linux/macOS only |

### Multiplexer

A multiplexer lets you split a terminal into panes, manage named sessions, and detach/reattach without losing state.

| Name | Windows | macOS/Linux | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **[vim](https://www.vim.org) / [Neovim](https://neovim.io)** | ✅ | ✅ | Editor-based approach — `:terminal` and pane splits give you multiple shells inside the editor; not a dedicated multiplexer but works everywhere natively |
| **[Zellij](https://zellij.dev)** | ✅ | ✅ | First major multiplexer with native Windows support (v0.44.0, March 2026); modern Rust-based, layouts, plugins, and session management |
| **[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)** | ❌ WSL only | ✅ | The gold standard on macOS/Linux; no native Windows support |
| **[psmux](https://github.com/psmux/psmux)** | ✅ only | ❌ | Native tmux-compatible multiplexer for Windows Terminal, PowerShell, and cmd.exe; zero dependencies, Rust-based |
| **[GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)** | ❌ WSL only | ✅ | Legacy but stable; predates tmux; mostly used on remote servers where tmux isn't available |

### Terminal Software Recommendations

Good pieces for a solid terminal workflow:

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **[fish](https://fishshell.com)** | Shell | Sensible defaults, autosuggestions, no config required to be useful |
| **[starship](https://starship.rs)** | Shell | Fast, minimal shell prompt, works with any shell |

| **[vim](https://www.vim.org)** | Editor | Self-customized vim is more efficient for vibe coding — no framework overhead |
| **[yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io)** | File Manager | Fast terminal file manager with preview |

| **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)** | Utility | Download video/audio from YouTube and hundreds of other sites |

### Agentic CLI

CLI tools that go beyond code completion — they plan, execute commands, manage files, search the web, and work through multi-step tasks autonomously in your terminal.

| Name | Subscription | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **[OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)** | GitHub Copilot | Open-source terminal AI agent, provider-agnostic |
| **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code)** | Claude Pro ($20/mo) or Max ($100/$200/mo) | Anthropic's terminal agent — strong at reasoning and long multi-step tasks |
| **[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)** | Free ($0) / Pro ($10/mo) / Pro+ ($39/mo) | GitHub-native terminal agent with `/plan`, `/fleet` for parallel execution |
| **[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** | Free (1k req/day) / Google One AI Premium | Google's open-source terminal agent, generous free tier, 1M token context |
| **[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)** | ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Team | OpenAI's terminal agent, lightweight, runs locally |

The browser is no longer a limitation. It's where the best tools live now.
